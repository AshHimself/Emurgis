# Emurgis
The most efficient way to get things done, ever.

## The problem
Emurgo doesn't currently have a way to concisely track problems that need to be solved. This produces confusion, inefficiencies, duplicated work, etc.

## The solution
A variant of the Collective Code Contstruction Contract is used to decide whether or not a problem is worth solving, and what the simplest possible solution is. This is a robust process which delivers results in the form of emergent properties. A side-effect of the process is that all aspects of the organization which use it become parallelized as it completely removes the neccessity for blocking processes such as meetings. All work within the organization can then be done asynchronously.
